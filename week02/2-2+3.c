/*    2.	Write a simple program that, given an integer n from the console,        creates a pointer to n, then carefully explains (via printf statements)        the difference between the pointer to n, the value of n, the & operator.    3.	Finish exercise 2 by explaining what the * operator does.*/#include <stdio.h>int main(){    //2-2    int n;    int *nptr;    printf("Enter an integer: ");    scanf("%d",&n);    nptr=&n;    printf("n = %d\tnptr = %d\n",n,nptr);    printf("'nptr' points to the memory location of 'n'.\n");    printf("'n' refers to the actual value of 'n', in this case '%d'\n",n);    printf("'&n' is the address of 'n', and is used to assign that address to 'nptr'.\n");    //2-3    printf("'*' declares a pointer, for example '*nptr'.\n");}
